A cluster in Node.js is a group of worker processes that can share the same server port and handle incoming requests. When you create a cluster, the master process spawns a number of worker processes that run concurrently and distribute the workload among them.

The master process is responsible for managing the worker processes and distributing incoming connections to them. Each worker process is a copy of the original Node.js process, with its own event loop and memory space.

In simpler terms, a Node.js cluster allows you to use multiple CPU cores to handle incoming requests, which can significantly improve the performance of your application. The cluster module provides a simple API for creating and managing worker processes, so you don't have to worry about the details of inter-process communication.
