#### Horizontal and Vertical scaling
Horizontal scaling is the process of increasing the capacity of a system by adding more computing resources, such as additional servers or instances, in order to distribute the workload across multiple machines.

In contrast to vertical scaling, which involves adding more resources to a single machine (e.g. increasing the CPU or RAM of a server), horizontal scaling allows a system to scale out across multiple machines, which can improve performance and reliability.

Horizontal scaling is commonly used in cloud computing environments, where additional instances or virtual machines can be provisioned on-demand to handle increased traffic or demand. By distributing the workload across multiple machines, horizontal scaling can help ensure that a system remains highly available and responsive, even during peak usage periods.
#### Diff between cluster chuld process and child process module
Here are some more key differences between the child_process and cluster modules in Node.js:

Communication: With the child_process module, communication between the parent and child processes happens through standard input and output streams, as well as other mechanisms such as message passing and inter-process communication. With the cluster module, communication between the master process and worker processes happens through the use of messaging and other IPC mechanisms.

Use cases: The child_process module is generally used for running long-running or blocking processes in a separate child process, such as running shell commands, spawning other Node.js processes, or running external programs. The cluster module is specifically designed for use with networked applications, where you need to parallelize networked I/O or other CPU-intensive tasks.

Performance: The cluster module can help improve the performance and scalability of your Node.js application by distributing the workload across multiple worker processes. This can be especially useful for applications that handle a large number of concurrent connections or require significant CPU processing power. The child_process module can also be used to improve performance in certain scenarios, but it is generally not as well-suited for high-concurrency, networked applications.

Scalability: The cluster module is designed to work with a single machine, but it can be used in conjunction with other scaling strategies, such as load balancing, to scale horizontally across multiple machines. The child_process module is generally used for spawning child processes on the same machine as the parent process and is not as well-suited for horizontal scaling.

In summary, the child_process and cluster modules have different use cases and are designed to solve different types of problems. The child_process module is generally used for spawning separate child processes, while the cluster module is used for parallelizing networked I/O or CPU-intensive tasks and improving the performance and scalability of Node.js applications.
#### Simulate high traffic
There are many tools and approaches for simulating high traffic and load testing your Node.js application. Here are a few options:

Load testing tools: There are many load testing tools available that allow you to simulate high traffic and measure how your application performs under different levels of load. Some popular load testing tools include Apache JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling, and Locust.

Custom scripts: You can also write custom scripts to simulate high traffic and generate requests to your Node.js application. For example, you could use a tool like Apache Bench (ab) to generate a large number of HTTP requests to your application.

Realistic scenarios: When testing your application, it's important to simulate realistic scenarios that are representative of your actual users. For example, you may want to simulate a mix of different types of requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) and different levels of concurrency.

Cloud-based testing: Another option is to use cloud-based testing services such as BlazeMeter or LoadImpact, which allow you to simulate high traffic from multiple locations around the world and generate detailed reports on how your application performed.

Regardless of the approach you choose, it's important to carefully monitor key performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and CPU usage during load testing to identify bottlenecks and ensure that your application can handle high traffic.
#### what is diff between http, http2, and https
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTP/2, and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are all protocols for transferring data over the internet, but they differ in their features and how they secure the data being transferred.

HTTP is the original protocol used for transferring data over the internet. It is a stateless protocol, which means that each request and response is independent of any previous requests or responses. It uses a plain text format to transfer data, which makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.

HTTP/2 is the next generation of HTTP and is designed to address some of the limitations of HTTP. It uses a binary format to transfer data, which is more efficient than the text-based format used by HTTP. It also introduces several new features, such as server push, which allows the server to send multiple resources to the client without the client having to request them individually.

HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data being transferred. It provides end-to-end encryption between the client and server, which means that the data cannot be read or tampered with by third parties. HTTPS is widely used for transferring sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data.

Here are some key differences between HTTP, HTTP/2, and HTTPS:

Data format: HTTP uses a plain text format, while HTTP/2 uses a binary format. HTTPS uses the same format as HTTP, but the data is encrypted.

Performance: HTTP/2 is designed to be faster than HTTP because it allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection. HTTPS can be slower than HTTP because the encryption and decryption process can add overhead.

Security: HTTPS provides end-to-end encryption, which makes it more secure than HTTP and HTTP/2. HTTP and HTTP/2 are vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.

Port: HTTP and HTTP/2 use port 80 by default, while HTTPS uses port 443.
#### what is rest api, graphql and diff
REST (Representational State Transfer) API and GraphQL are both ways of designing and exposing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to clients for accessing server-side data and functionality.

REST API is a standard set of rules and constraints for creating web services, which are used to build web-based applications. It typically uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources on a server, where each resource is identified by a unique URL. RESTful APIs use a limited set of well-defined HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to interact with these resources in a stateless manner, meaning that each request contains all the information necessary for the server to complete the request.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs, developed by Facebook. It is a more flexible and powerful alternative to REST APIs, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need from the server and in what format. With GraphQL, the client sends a query to the server that describes the data it needs, and the server returns only the requested data in a JSON object. This can lead to more efficient data transfer, as the client only receives the data it needs, and can also simplify the client-side code, as it can reduce the need for multiple requests and data manipulation.

Some key differences between REST API and GraphQL are:

Data fetching: In REST API, each endpoint usually represents a specific resource and returns all the data related to that resource, while in GraphQL, the client specifies exactly what data it needs and in what format.

Data manipulation: REST API uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint to perform all operations, using a query language to specify what operations to perform.

Caching: REST API relies on HTTP caching to improve performance, while in GraphQL, caching is often done at the query level, as the client can specify the exact data it needs, reducing the amount of data that needs to be cached.

Learning curve: REST API is easier to understand and implement for developers who are new to API design, while GraphQL requires a deeper understanding of the query language and its capabilities.

In summary, both REST API and GraphQL have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project. REST API is well-suited for simple, resource-based APIs, while GraphQL is more flexible and powerful for more complex data-fetching scenarios.
